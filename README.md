# Discord-Bots
This is a repository that contains examples of some of the Discord bots I have made for fun.


## Corazon_bot
This is my first Discord bot! I wrote it to just get a grasp of the basic functionality of the Discord API, as well as just to have a little fun. It is themed after the popular One Piece character Corazon, and quotes him when prompted with one of his 'commands'.

## Ghoto_bot
This is a Discord bot I wrote in order to play around with using the chat 'command' feature to orchistrate other python code I have written. There are a few small games it can play, and I have more features in the works for this bot in the future!
